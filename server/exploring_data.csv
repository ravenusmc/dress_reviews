40,General,Bottoms,Jeans,Amazing fit and wash,"Like other reviewers i was hesitant to spend this much on a pair of jeans. however, i purchased them at  20% off on retailer day and...honestly...they look so good i probably would have paid full price. these jeans are fresh!",5,1
62,General Petite,Tops,Blouses,Lovely and unique!,"As is true of a bunch of the fall clothing photos, the colors are totally washed out in these model images which is such a shame. the embroidery is bright and vivid and totally unique on this! the bib area is actually a soft corduroy which i think is nice to transition into fall and winter. in terms of fit, i do feel like this is maybe geared more towards the slender build - it is a slim cut which i found really flattering for me since i sometimes swim in tunics. at 5'7"", 128# with a very small",5,1
47,General Petite,Bottoms,Skirts,Meh,"I so wanted this skirt to work, love the design! but, it's way, way too long... i am 5, 5, 116lb, and the small is 1 inch on the floor. i step on the skirt as i walk.",1,0
45,General Petite,Bottoms,Pants,Wow,"Love love this! i was hesitant to buy this at first - the reviews made it seem so big and i wasn't sure if it was my kind of outfit. but i wanted to try a jumpsuit and this was the perfect find! the xs was a typical retailer size for me, so the size was good in this, too. the color is fabulous and the fit is great. the rise is slightly short, but not a problem. i can't wait to where it for my next great event. i wish i could buy it in the black, too.",5,1
37,Initmates,Intimate,Swim,Great for bigger busts,"I absolutely love the retro look of this swimsuit. i first saw it on blogger amber fillerup-clark (barefoot blonde) and i knew i had to have it. this is the first one piece suit i've purchased in about six years. i've avoided one pieces because most of the ones i tried made me feel frumpy, and the mono-kini look just looked odd on me. i have a smaller frame and a larger bust (32ddd), so finding swimsuits that fit properly is a challenge. i am a size 4 but i ordered a size 6 after reading reviews",5,1
43,General,Tops,Sweaters,Love the pattern and color,"I love this sweater but i'm on the fence about keeping it only because i haven't figured out a way to layer and wear it. it really does appear best with a plain white top and jeans. i've tried it with several other things in my closet and just haven't found another combination that sells it for me - i really like my pieces to be more versatile so i can mix and match them into other outfits. this piece is just enough of a ""statement"" that - for me - wearing it with more simple clothing staples is",4,1
83,General,Tops,Sweaters,Beautiful and unique.,"Love this sweater!
soft and cozy and the ruffles are not overwhelming.....just a touch of pretty!
it will look pretty with a turquoise necklace for a pop of color!
classic, comfy and classy!
an anhtro a ++++++++
runs very true to size, ordered my usual size an it fits perfectly.",5,1
34,General,Tops,Knits,Unique and wonderful,"The sweater is comfortable and a good weight. the zipper is very difficult, but i do not have to unzip the sweater to pull it on.",5,1
49,General Petite,Tops,Fine gauge,Great look all in one,"I love everything about this sweater. it is very well made, beautiful material and such an effortless way to pull it all together. it runs large which was unfortunate for me as i bought the xs petite and i really need xxs in this one, but none are left. i am 5 ft. tall and weigh about 96 pounds. i can wear a 0 but not in this sweater. it runs very well and i highly recommend it. hope they make more in this style. it is so fresh looking and so comfortable.",5,1
49,General,Tops,Knits,Beauty meets comfort,"I love this top, the details at the neck and shoulders are lovely, both front and back. it's also very comfortable and soft, allowing you look nicely dressed while feeling like you are wearing a soft tee-shirt. the sleeves are a good length with some elastic at the cuffs so you can push them up. sadly, it's sold out in in my size online and in the stores, otherwise i would certainly snap it up at the sale price.",5,1
32,General,Tops,Knits,Great fit,"I have been searching around for new and unique clothes to wear to work. this top is cute, comfortable, and well made. these are all qualities that i look for when purchasing clothes. also the shirt is flattering for the stomach if you are like me and had a baby.",5,1
41,General Petite,Tops,Knits,Adore! but the white *is* sheer,"I own this in the dark blue and adore it. i read reviews later as i was pondering buying the white (why is it so hard to find a white shirt anymore that isn't see-through?!). one of the first reviewers raved that it wasn't see-through. i ordered it and ... nope, it's totally see-through. i tried it on and immediately saw the entire outline of my nude bra, and worse still - my belly button. back it went. i got the green instead. bummer about the white - fabric's different than the others.",4,1
53,General,Bottoms,Skirts,"Not red, not orange...","Yes, as much as i'd have liked this to be a true red, it's kind of red-orange; i am relieved, however that it is not as orange as it looks on my monitor! that is my only slight-and i mean slight-disappointment in this cute-as-all-get-out skirt! i am 5""5"" 140 lbs and the six is perfect, leading me to believe that this is tts. it is a polyester mix with a same-color liner, large buttons followed by smaller, silver colored buttons at the apron. the larger buttonholes are red and white striped and t",5,1
23,General,Bottoms,Skirts,"Cute, but not flattering on","I really loved this skirt on the model, but it just wasn't flattering when i received my order. i ordered two sizes - 2 and 4. i am 5'4, athletic build and the front closure made my waist look much larger than it is. the back of the skirt also flared out more than i expected it to. 

sadly, i had to return both. perhaps this would look better on someone with a much taller frame.",2,0
31,General,Dresses,Dresses,Not for my curves,"5'7"", 34c, 28 jeans, size 4 dress. fell in love with the pattern in particular, knowing the design might not work best for my body. ordered the size small - it was not unflattering - but it did nothing for my body type. if anything, the excess fabric made me appear wider and made my waist non-existent. the trouble was that the skirt portion has the elastic band starting high - approximately right under your chest - almost like an empire waist (this is hidden by the flap of material hanging over",3,0
64,General,Tops,Sweaters,Itchy!,"I love the idea of this coat and foolishly purchased other items in happy anticipation of its arrival.

the description does not say ""lined,"" and i hoped for soft wool that i recently got on the ""yellow with white piping"" sweater coat. this is hard, coarse, itchy wool - impossible for me to wear an unlined garment. i am consistently puzzled by the high prices for garments that are unlined when they really need to be. it went back, and i cannot really recommend this as i know i am not the only",3,0
50,General Petite,Dresses,Dresses,Great with leggings,"This dress is too short for me to wear as a dress, at 5'7"" and over 40. however is is great with leggings and boots.
it drapes nicely not over sized like many dresses this style. the color is more earthy than pictured. it's actually nicer in person than online. and it has a wonderful texture to it. i was drawn to it when i walked in the store they had it on display under s short cropped jacket and boots.",4,1
50,General Petite,Bottoms,Pants,Perfect white pants,I love these pants purchased them in white the fit is great the fabric is just the right thickness given they are white i don't want the fabric to be too thin a bit long so i will have to have them tailored but vey happy with these pants,5,1
40,Initmates,Intimate,Swim,Wowser,"Made by dawn suits are the bomb. the bottom is a tiny bit cheeky, but not thong territory- just enough side leg to be seriously sexy. the quality is fantastic, soft with nude lining. love the retro feel to the high neck top- enough support even for my 36d's. so comfy, i forgot i was wearing it at lunch. the normal triangle tops cut into my shoulders/neck, and this style does not. amazing quality and well worth the price.
fyi- large top fit perfectly, but i needed a medium bottom.",5,1
38,General,Bottoms,Pants,"Pretty, but a bit small","I can't decide on these pants. after trying them on in the store, they are very soft and a beautiful blue color. however, i found them a bit small. i usually take a l in retailer pants, and these are very tight. probably could pull them off with a tunic top, however, in spite of the fabric, the fit was just not comfortable for me. a good alternative for denim if you are slender, rather than curvy.",4,1
